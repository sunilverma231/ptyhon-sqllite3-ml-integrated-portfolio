## üîç Contents

### 1. Week4_Insert_Update_SQLite
Focuses on using `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements with SQLite to manipulate structured data. Ideal for learning data modification operations in SQL.

### 2. mod5_final_project
Capstone-style project involving data extraction, cleaning, and basic analysis using SQL on a structured dataset. Includes summarization, filtering, and ordering.

### 3. DB0201EN-Week4-1-1-RealDataPractice-v5_sqlite_Learner
Hands-on practice with a real-world SQLite database. Applies joins, aggregation functions, and filtering to extract insights from complex data relationships.

### 4. DB0201EN-Week3-1-3-SQLmagic_SQlite
Demonstrates the use of `%sql` magic commands inside Jupyter notebooks to run SQL queries directly in Python environments. Includes examples with conditional logic and grouping.

### 5. ML0101EN_SkillUp_FinalAssignment.jupyterlite_1
Final assignment involving K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification. Applies preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a lightweight JupyterLite environment.
